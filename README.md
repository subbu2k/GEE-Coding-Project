# GEE-Coding-Project
Climate Change Project done as part of Course MS3001D Engineering Economics(CS)

Objectives:

•	Develop the JavaScript Code for extracting zonal statistics in the GEE (Google Earth Engine) Code editor.
•	Extract the Zonal Statistics of the attribute ‘live green vegetation’ at City level as a CSV file. 
•	Use the Cities- Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai as your frame of study.
•	Calculate the values of live green vegetation in these cities of India.
•	Use the zonal statistics (.csv file) extracted to create plots {You can plot them as choropleth maps (One can use Python)} and answer the core questions.

Data:

Use the GEE dataset: MOD13A2.006 Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global 1km (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MOD13A2)
Use  https://github.com/datameet/Municipal_Spatial_Data for spatial data on cities.
